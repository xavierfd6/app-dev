## My favorite anime is *one piece* written by *Eiichiro Oda*.

One Piece is a popular Japanese anime and manga series created by Eiichiro Oda. It follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy,
a young pirate who can stretch his body like rubber after eating a magical "Devil Fruit." Luffy dreams of finding the legendary
treasure known as the "One Piece" and becoming the Pirate King. He gathers a diverse crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,
each with unique abilities and backstories, as they explore the Grand Line, facing powerful enemies, discovering ancient secrets, and forming alliances.

Here are some list of my favorite character in the series:
1. **Monkey D. Luffy** – Bounty: 3,000,000,000 Berries – A fearless and determined pirate with the goal of becoming the Pirate King, known for his rubber-like abilities and strong sense of justice.

2. **Shanks** – Bounty: 4,048,900,000 Berries – A powerful pirate and former mentor to Luffy, known for his calm demeanor and immense influence on the world.

3. **Roronoa Zoro** – Bounty: 1,111,000,000 Berries – A skilled swordsman who wields three swords, with the ambition of becoming the world's greatest swordsman.

4. **Jinbe** – Bounty: 1,100,000,000 Berries – A former Warlord of the Sea and skilled fish-man martial artist, known for his wisdom and loyalty to Luffy.

5. **Dracule Mihawk** – Bounty: Unknown – The world's greatest swordsman, whose unmatched skill and reputation make him a fearsome figure in the pirate world.
